# Development Journal – Carsharing Mobile App

## Day 1 – Project Initialization

Today I created the GitHub repository for my Carsharing Mobile Application project.

The purpose of this application is to develop a mobile platform where users can:
- Register and log in
- View available cars
- Book a car
- Make payments
- Manage their profile

Next step: Define the technology stack and application architecture.
