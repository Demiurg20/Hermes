**Hermes – Carsharing Mobile Application**

***Chapter 1 – Problem Statement and Rationale***

Today many big cities have serious transport problems. The number of private cars has increased a lot between 2019 and 2024. Because of this, cities face traffic jams, air pollution, lack of parking spaces, and high fuel consumption.

Research studies from recent years show that shared mobility services, such as carsharing, can help improve urban transportation systems (Martin & Shaheen, 2022). Carsharing allows people to use a car when they need it without buying one. This can reduce the number of cars on the road and improve vehicle usage.

A literature review published in 2021 explains that carsharing systems can support sustainable transport if they are well organized and connected with city infrastructure (Jochem et al., 2021).

For these reasons, the Hermes mobile application is created. Hermes aims to provide an easy and modern way for people to rent cars using their smartphones. The goal is to make transportation more flexible, affordable, and efficient.

***1.1 Existing Carsharing Applications (Market Overview)***

There are several successful carsharing applications around the world.

1. Zipcar is a service where users can rent cars by the hour or by the day. It mainly works in cities and near universities.

2. Turo is a peer-to-peer platform. Car owners can rent their personal vehicles to other people.

3. Getaround allows users to unlock cars using a mobile app. This makes the process faster and more convenient.

4. Share Now (Car2Go) uses a free-floating model. Users can pick up and leave the car anywhere inside a city area.

5. Yandex Drive uses dynamic pricing and real-time tracking to manage cars efficiently.

These examples show that carsharing is popular and possible to develop. However, there are still some problems that need improvement.


***Chapter 2 – Existing Problems and Justification for Hermes***

Even though carsharing is growing, there are still important challenges.

First, studies show that carsharing does not always reduce private car ownership as much as expected (Bucsky, 2022). This means services must improve their systems to become more effective.

Second, managing vehicles is difficult. Companies must control car locations, maintenance, and availability. Research explains that technology such as tracking systems and keyless access is very important for service quality (Wang et al., 2024).

Third, some users do not trust digital platforms. Problems with identity verification, payment security, and complicated booking systems reduce user interest.

The Hermes application plans to solve these problems by:

        Providing secure and simple login

        Showing real-time car availability

        Offering clear pricing

        Making booking and payment easy

        Designing a simple and user-friendly interface

Hermes aims to improve the carsharing experience and support better urban mobility.
